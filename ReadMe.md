### THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT

Authour: TinNT


Project includes 2 directories **Basic_Syntax** and **OOP**
In the *Basic_Syntax* directory, I have created several modules which
are examples of basic structures in python programming.

In the *OOP* directory, I have also added various modules, may be classes
for Oriented Object Programming Illustration.
